## 🤖 Multi-Agent AI System with LangGraph - Now Live!

Just deployed a powerful **multi-agent AI system** that demonstrates the future of AI-powered workflows!

## What It Does:
✨ **Researcher Agent** - Searches the web for real-time information
✍️ **Writer Agent** - Generates high-quality blog posts based on research
🔗 **LangGraph** - Orchestrates seamless agent collaboration

## The Architecture:
A clean, sequential workflow where:
- Input: Any topic you choose
- Researcher: Gathers current data
- Writer: Crafts engaging content
- Output: Complete blog post

## Why This Matters:
This is a practical example of how **multi-agent AI systems** can:
- Automate complex workflows
- Combine specialized agents for better results
- Demonstrate state management between LLMs
- Show the power of LangGraph orchestration

## Try It Yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/thukralhanshika3-glitch/AI-AGENT.git
cd AI-AGENT
pip install -r requirements.txt
python INDEX.PY
```

Change the topic in one line and watch the agents work their magic!

## Tech Stack:
- LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- LangChain for LLM integration
- DuckDuckGo for web search
- Python for core implementation

This is just the beginning. Imagine scaling this to:
- User research analysis
- Content generation at scale
- Real-time market analysis
- Team collaboration workflows

The future is multi-agent! 🚀
